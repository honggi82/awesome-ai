### ABSTRACT

Caﬀe provides multimedia scientists and practitioners with a clean and modiﬁable framework for state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and a collection of reference models. The framework is a BSD-licensed C++ library with Python and MATLAB bindings for training and deploying generalpurpose convolutional neural networks and other deep models eﬃciently on commodity architectures. Caﬀe ﬁts industry and internet-scale media needs by CUDA GPU computation, processing over 40 million images a day on a single K40 or Titan GPU (≈ 2.5 ms per image). By separating model representation from actual implementation, Caﬀe allows experimentation and seamless switching among platforms for ease of development and deployment from prototyping machines to cloud environments.

Caﬀe is maintained and developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) with the help of an active community of contributors on GitHub. It powers ongoing research projects, large-scale industrial applications, and startup prototypes in vision, speech, and multimedia.

### 1. INTRODUCTION

A key problem in multimedia data analysis is discovery of eﬀective representations for sensory inputs—images, soundwaves, haptics, etc. While performance of conventional, handcrafted features has plateaued in recent years, new developments in deep compositional architectures have kept performance levels rising [8]. Deep models have outperformed hand-engineered feature representations in many domains, and made learning possible in domains where engineered features were lacking entirely.

We are particularly motivated by large-scale visual recognition, where a speciﬁc type of deep architecture has achieved a commanding lead on the state-of-the-art. These Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are discriminatively trained via back-propagation through layers of convolutional ﬁlters and other operations such as rectiﬁcation and pooling. Following the early success of digit classiﬁcation in the 90’s, these models have recently surpassed all known methods for large-scale visual recognition, and have been adopted by industry heavyweights such as Google, Facebook, and Baidu for image understanding and search.

While deep neural networks have attracted enthusiastic interest within computer vision and beyond, replication of published results can involve months of work by a researcher or engineer. Sometimes researchers deem it worthwhile to release trained models along with the paper advertising their performance. But trained models alone are not suﬃcient for rapid research progress and emerging commercial applications, and few toolboxes oﬀer truly oﬀ-the-shelf deployment of state-of-the-art models—and those that do are often not computationally eﬃcient and thus unsuitable for commercial deployment.

To address such problems, we present Caﬀe, a fully opensource framework that aﬀords clear access to deep architectures. The code is written in clean, eﬃcient C++, with CUDA used for GPU computation, and nearly complete, well-supported bindings to Python/Numpy and MATLAB. Caﬀe adheres to software engineering best practices, providing unit tests for correctness and experimental rigor and speed for deployment. It is also well-suited for research use, due to the careful modularity of the code, and the clean separation of network deﬁnition (usually the novel part of deep learning research) from actual implementation.

In Caﬀe, multimedia scientists and practitioners have an orderly and extensible toolkit for state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, with reference models provided out of the box. Fast CUDA code and GPU computation ﬁt industry needs by achieving processing speeds of more than 40 mil-

The same models can be run in CPU or GPU mode on a variety of hardware: Caﬀe separates the representation from the actual implementation, and seamless switching between heterogeneous platforms furthers development and deploymentCaﬀe can even be run in the cloud.

While Caﬀe was ﬁrst designed for vision, it has been adopted

and improved by users in speech recognition, robotics, neuroscience, and astronomy. We hope to see this trend continue so that further sciences and industries can take advantage of deep learning.

Caﬀe is maintained and developed by the BVLC with the active eﬀorts of several graduate students, and welcomes open-source contributions at http://github.com/BVLC/caffe. We thank all of our contributors for their work!

### 2. HIGHLIGHTS OF CAFFE

Caﬀe provides a complete toolkit for training, testing, ﬁnetuning, and deploying models, with well-documented examples for all of these tasks. As such, it’s an ideal starting point for researchers and other developers looking to jump into state-of-the-art machine learning. At the same time, it’s likely the fastest available implementation of these algorithms, making it immediately useful for industrial deployment.

Modularity. The software is designed from the beginning to be as modular as possible, allowing easy extension to new data formats, network layers, and loss functions. Lots of layers and loss functions are already implemented, and plentiful examples show how these are composed into trainable recognition systems for various tasks.

Separation of representation and implementation. Caﬀe model deﬁnitions are written as conﬁg ﬁles using the Protocol Buﬀer language. Caﬀe supports network architectures in the form of arbitrary directed acyclic graphs. Upon instantiation, Caﬀe reserves exactly as much memory as needed for the network, and abstracts from its underlying location in host or GPU. Switching between a CPU and GPU implementation is exactly one function call.

Test coverage. Every single module in Caﬀe has a test, and no new code is accepted into the project without corresponding tests. This allows rapid improvements and refactoring of the codebase, and imparts a welcome feeling of peacefulness to the researchers using the code.

Python and MATLAB bindings. For rapid prototyping and interfacing with existing research code, Caﬀe provides Python and MATLAB bindings. Both languages

may be used to construct networks and classify inputs. The Python bindings also expose the solver module for easy prototyping of new training procedures.

Pre-trained reference models. Caﬀe provides (for academic and non-commercial use—not BSD license) reference models for visual tasks, including the landmark “AlexNet” ImageNet model [8] with variations and the R-CNN detection model [3]. More are scheduled for release. We are strong proponents of reproducible research: we hope that a common software substrate will foster quick progress in the search over network architectures and applications.

- 2.1 Comparison to related software

We summarize the landscape of convolutional neural network software used in recent publications in Table 1. While our list is incomplete, we have included the toolkits that are most notable to the best of our knowledge. Caﬀe diﬀers from other contemporary CNN frameworks in two major ways:

- (1) The implementation is completely C++ based, which

eases integration into existing C++ systems and interfaces common in industry. The CPU mode removes the barrier of specialized hardware for deployment and experiments once a model is trained.

- (2) Reference models are provided oﬀ-the-shelf for quick

experimentation with state-of-the-art results, without the need for costly re-learning. By ﬁnetuning for related tasks, such as those explored by [2], these models provide a warmstart to new research and applications. Crucially, we publish not only the trained models but also the recipes and code to reproduce them.

3.1 Data Storage

Caﬀe stores and communicates data in 4-dimensional arrays called blobs.

Blobs provide a uniﬁed memory interface, holding batches of images (or other data), parameters, or parameter updates. Blobs conceal the computational and mental overhead of mixed CPU/GPU operation by synchronizing from the CPU host to the GPU device as needed. In practice, one loads data from the disk to a blob in CPU code, calls a CUDA kernel to do GPU computation, and ferries the blob oﬀ to the next layer, ignoring low-level details while maintaining a high level of performance. Memory on the host and device is allocated on demand (lazily) for eﬃcient memory usage.

Models are saved to disk as Google Protocol Buﬀers1, which have several important features: minimal-size binary strings when serialized, eﬃcient serialization, a human-readable text format compatible with the binary version, and eﬃcient interface implementations in multiple languages, most notably C++ and Python.

Large-scale data is stored in LevelDB2 databases. In our test program, LevelDB and Protocol Buﬀers provide a throughput of 150MB/s on commodity machines with minimal CPU impact. Thanks to layer-wise design (discussed below) and code modularity, we have recently added support for other data sources, including some contributed by the open source community.

### 3.2 Layers

A Caﬀe layer is the essence of a neural network layer: it takes one or more blobs as input, and yields one or more blobs as output. Layers have two key responsibilities for the operation of the network as a whole: a forward pass that takes the inputs and produces the outputs, and a backward pass that takes the gradient with respect to the output, and computes the gradients with respect to the parameters and to the inputs, which are in turn back-propagated to earlier layers.

Caﬀe provides a complete set of layer types including: convolution, pooling, inner products, nonlinearities like rectiﬁed linear and logistic, local response normalization, elementwise operations, and losses like softmax and hinge. These are all the types needed for state-of-the-art visual tasks. Coding custom layers requires minimal eﬀort due to the compositional construction of networks.

### 3.3 Networks and Run Mode

Caﬀe does all the bookkeeping for any directed acyclic graph of layers, ensuring correctness of the forward and backward passes. Caﬀe models are end-to-end machine learning systems. A typical network begins with a data layer that loads from disk and ends with a loss layer that computes the objective for a task such as classiﬁcation or reconstruction.

The network is run on CPU or GPU by setting a single switch. Layers come with corresponding CPU and GPU routines that produce identical results (with tests to prove it). The CPU/GPU switch is seamless and independent of the model deﬁnition.

### 3.4 Training A Network

Caﬀe trains models by the fast and standard stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Figure 1 shows a typical example of a Caﬀe network (for MNIST digit classiﬁcation) during training: a data layer fetches the images and labels

from disk, passes it through multiple layers such as convolution, pooling and rectiﬁed linear transforms, and feeds the ﬁnal prediction into a classiﬁcation loss layer that produces the loss and gradients which train the whole network. This example is found in the Caﬀe source code at examples/lenet/lenet_train.prototxt. Data are processed in mini-batches that pass through the network sequentially. Vital to training are learning rate decay schedules, momentum, and snapshots for stopping and resuming, all of which are implemented and documented.

Finetuning, the adaptation of an existing model to new architectures or data, is a standard method in Caﬀe. From a snapshot of an existing network and a model deﬁnition for the new network, Caﬀe ﬁnetunes the old model weights for the new task and initializes new weights as needed. This capability is essential for tasks such as knowledge transfer [2], object detection [3], and object retrieval [5].

### 4. APPLICATIONS AND EXAMPLES

In its ﬁrst six months since public release, Caﬀe has already been used in a large number of research projects at UC Berkeley and other universities, achieving state-of-theart performance on a number of tasks. Members of Berkeley EECS have also collaborated with several industry partners such as Facebook [11] and Adobe [6], using Caﬀe or its direct precursor (Decaf) to obtain state-of-the-art results.

Object Classiﬁcation Caﬀe has an online demo3 showing state-of-the-art object classiﬁcation on images provided by the users, including via mobile phone. The demo takes the image and tries to categorize it into one of the 1,000 ImageNet categories4. A typical classiﬁcation result is shown in Figure 2.

Furthermore, we have successfully trained a model with all 10,000 categories of the full ImageNet dataset by ﬁnetuning this network. The resulting network has been applied to open vocabulary object retrieval [5].

##### Figure 3: Features extracted from a deep network, visualized in a 2-dimensional space. Note the clear separation between categories, indicative of a successful embedding.

Learning Semantic Features In addition to end-to-end training, Caﬀe can also be used to extract semantic features from images using a pre-trained network. These features can be used “downstream” in other vision tasks with great success [2]. Figure 3 shows a two-dimensional embedding of all the ImageNet validation images, colored by a coarse category that they come from. The nice separation testiﬁes to a successful semantic embedding.

Intriguingly, this learned feature is useful for a lot more than object categories. For example, Karayev et al. have shown promising results ﬁnding images of diﬀerent styles such as “Vintage” and “Romantic” using Caﬀe features (Figure 4) [6].

Object Detection Most notably, Caﬀe has enabled us to obtain by far the best performance on object detection, evaluated on the hardest academic datasets: the PASCAL VOC 2007-2012 and the ImageNet 2013 Detection challenge [3].

Girshick et al. [3] have combined Caﬀe together with techniques such as Selective Search [10] to eﬀectively perform simultaneous localization and recognition in natural images.

###### Figure 5 shows a sketch of their approach. Beginners’ Guides To help users get started with in-

stalling, using, and modifying Caﬀe, we have provided instructions and tutorials on the Caﬀe webpage. The tutorials range from small demos (MNIST digit recognition) to serious deployments (end-to-end learning on ImageNet).

Although these tutorials serve as eﬀective documentation of the functionality of Caﬀe, the Caﬀe source code additionally provides detailed inline documentation on all modules.
