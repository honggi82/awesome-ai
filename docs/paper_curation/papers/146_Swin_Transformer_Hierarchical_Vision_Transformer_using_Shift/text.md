### Abstract

This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efﬁciency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the ﬂexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classiﬁcation (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO testdev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-theart by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneﬁcial for all-MLP architectures. The code and models are publicly available at https://github. com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer.

### 1. Introduction

Modeling in computer vision has long been dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Beginning with AlexNet [39] and its revolutionary performance on the ImageNet image classiﬁcation challenge, CNN architectures have evolved to become increasingly powerful through

Figure 1. (a) The proposed Swin Transformer builds hierarchical feature maps by merging image patches (shown in gray) in deeper layers and has linear computation complexity to input image size due to computation of self-attention only within each local window (shown in red). It can thus serve as a general-purpose backbone for both image classiﬁcation and dense recognition tasks. (b) In contrast, previous vision Transformers [20] produce feature maps of a single low resolution and have quadratic computation complexity to input image size due to computation of selfattention globally.

greater scale [30, 76], more extensive connections [34], and more sophisticated forms of convolution [70, 18, 84]. With CNNs serving as backbone networks for a variety of vision tasks, these architectural advances have led to performance improvements that have broadly lifted the entire ﬁeld.

On the other hand, the evolution of network architectures in natural language processing (NLP) has taken a different path, where the prevalent architecture today is instead the Transformer [64]. Designed for sequence modeling and transduction tasks, the Transformer is notable for its use of attention to model long-range dependencies in the data. Its tremendous success in the language domain has led researchers to investigate its adaptation to computer vision, where it has recently demonstrated promising results on certain tasks, speciﬁcally image classiﬁcation [20] and joint vision-language modeling [47].

In this paper, we seek to expand the applicability of Transformer such that it can serve as a general-purpose

backbone for computer vision, as it does for NLP and as CNNs do in vision. We observe that signiﬁcant challenges in transferring its high performance in the language domain to the visual domain can be explained by differences between the two modalities. One of these differences involves scale. Unlike the word tokens that serve as the basic elements of processing in language Transformers, visual elements can vary substantially in scale, a problem that receives attention in tasks such as object detection [42, 53, 54]. In existing Transformer-based models [64, 20], tokens are all of a ﬁxed scale, a property unsuitable for these vision applications. Another difference is the much higher resolution of pixels in images compared to words in passages of text. There exist many vision tasks such as semantic segmentation that require dense prediction at the pixel level, and this would be intractable for Transformer on high-resolution images, as the computational complexity of its self-attention is quadratic to image size. To overcome these issues, we propose a generalpurpose Transformer backbone, called Swin Transformer, which constructs hierarchical feature maps and has linear computational complexity to image size. As illustrated in Figure 1(a), Swin Transformer constructs a hierarchical representation by starting from small-sized patches (outlined in gray) and gradually merging neighboring patches in deeper Transformer layers. With these hierarchical feature maps, the Swin Transformer model can conveniently leverage advanced techniques for dense prediction such as feature pyramid networks (FPN) [42] or U-Net [51]. The linear computational complexity is achieved by computing self-attention locally within non-overlapping windows that partition an image (outlined in red). The number of patches in each window is ﬁxed, and thus the complexity becomes linear to image size. These merits make Swin Transformer suitable as a general-purpose backbone for various vision tasks, in contrast to previous Transformer based architectures [20] which produce feature maps of a single resolution and have quadratic complexity.

- A key design element of Swin Transformer is its shift

of the window partition between consecutive self-attention layers, as illustrated in Figure 2. The shifted windows bridge the windows of the preceding layer, providing connections among them that signiﬁcantly enhance modeling power (see Table 4). This strategy is also efﬁcient in regards to real-world latency: all query patches within a window share the same key set1, which facilitates memory access in hardware. In contrast, earlier sliding window based self-attention approaches [33, 50] suffer from low latency on general hardware due to different key sets for different query pixels2. Our experiments show that the proposed

1The query and key are projection vectors in a self-attention layer. 2While there are efﬁcient methods to implement a sliding-window

based convolution layer on general hardware, thanks to its shared kernel

[Figure 2]

Figure 2. An illustration of the shifted window approach for computing self-attention in the proposed Swin Transformer architecture. In layer l (left), a regular window partitioning scheme is adopted, and self-attention is computed within each window. In the next layer l + 1 (right), the window partitioning is shifted, resulting in new windows. The self-attention computation in the new windows crosses the boundaries of the previous windows in layer l, providing connections among them.

shifted window approach has much lower latency than the sliding window method, yet is similar in modeling power (see Tables 5 and 6). The shifted window approach also proves beneﬁcial for all-MLP architectures [61].

The proposed Swin Transformer achieves strong performance on the recognition tasks of image classiﬁcation, object detection and semantic segmentation. It outperforms the ViT / DeiT [20, 63] and ResNe(X)t models [30, 70] signiﬁcantly with similar latency on the three tasks. Its 58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on the COCO test-dev set surpass the previous state-of-the-art results by +2.7 box AP (Copy-paste [26] without external data) and +2.6 mask AP (DetectoRS [46]). On ADE20K semantic segmentation, it obtains 53.5 mIoU on the val set, an improvement of +3.2 mIoU over the previous state-of-the-art (SETR [81]). It also achieves a top-1 accuracy of 87.3% on ImageNet-1K image classiﬁcation.

It is our belief that a uniﬁed architecture across computer vision and natural language processing could beneﬁt both ﬁelds, since it would facilitate joint modeling of visual and textual signals and the modeling knowledge from both domains can be more deeply shared. We hope that Swin Transformer’s strong performance on various vision problems can drive this belief deeper in the community and encourage uniﬁed modeling of vision and language signals.

### 2. Related Work

CNN and variants CNNs serve as the standard network model throughout computer vision. While the CNN has existed for several decades [40], it was not until the introduction of AlexNet [39] that the CNN took off and became mainstream. Since then, deeper and more effective convolutional neural architectures have been proposed to further propel the deep learning wave in computer vision, e.g., VGG [52], GoogleNet [57], ResNet [30], DenseNet [34],

weights across a feature map, it is difﬁcult for a sliding-window based self-attention layer to have efﬁcient memory access in practice.

HRNet [65], and EfﬁcientNet [58]. In addition to these architectural advances, there has also been much work on improving individual convolution layers, such as depthwise convolution [70] and deformable convolution [18, 84]. While the CNN and its variants are still the primary backbone architectures for computer vision applications, we highlight the strong potential of Transformer-like architectures for uniﬁed modeling between vision and language. Our work achieves strong performance on several basic visual recognition tasks, and we hope it will contribute to a modeling shift.

Self-attention based backbone architectures Also inspired by the success of self-attention layers and Transformer architectures in the NLP ﬁeld, some works employ self-attention layers to replace some or all of the spatial convolution layers in the popular ResNet [33, 50, 80]. In these works, the self-attention is computed within a local window of each pixel to expedite optimization [33], and they achieve slightly better accuracy/FLOPs trade-offs than the counterpart ResNet architecture. However, their costly memory access causes their actual latency to be signiﬁcantly larger than that of the convolutional networks [33]. Instead of using sliding windows, we propose to shift windows between consecutive layers, which allows for a more efﬁcient implementation in general hardware.

Self-attention/Transformers to complement CNNs Another line of work is to augment a standard CNN architecture with self-attention layers or Transformers. The selfattention layers can complement backbones [67, 7, 3, 71, 23, 74, 55] or head networks [32, 27] by providing the capability to encode distant dependencies or heterogeneous interactions. More recently, the encoder-decoder design in Transformer has been applied for the object detection and instance segmentation tasks [8, 13, 85, 56]. Our work explores the adaptation of Transformers for basic visual feature extraction and is complementary to these works.

##### Transformer based vision backbones Most related to

- our work is the Vision Transformer (ViT) [20] and its follow-ups [63, 72, 15, 28, 66]. The pioneering work of ViT directly applies a Transformer architecture on nonoverlapping medium-sized image patches for image classiﬁcation. It achieves an impressive speed-accuracy tradeoff on image classiﬁcation compared to convolutional networks. While ViT requires large-scale training datasets (i.e., JFT-300M) to perform well, DeiT [63] introduces several training strategies that allow ViT to also be effective using the smaller ImageNet-1K dataset. The results of ViT on image classiﬁcation are encouraging, but its architecture is unsuitable for use as a general-purpose backbone network on dense vision tasks or when the input image

resolution is high, due to its low-resolution feature maps and the quadratic increase in complexity with image size. There are a few works applying ViT models to the dense vision tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation by direct upsampling or deconvolution but with relatively lower performance [2, 81]. Concurrent to our work are some that modify the ViT architecture [72, 15, 28] for better image classiﬁcation. Empirically, we ﬁnd our Swin Transformer architecture to achieve the best speedaccuracy trade-off among these methods on image classiﬁcation, even though our work focuses on general-purpose performance rather than speciﬁcally on classiﬁcation. Another concurrent work [66] explores a similar line of thinking to build multi-resolution feature maps on Transformers. Its complexity is still quadratic to image size, while ours is linear and also operates locally which has proven beneﬁcial in modeling the high correlation in visual signals [36, 25, 41]. Our approach is both efﬁcient and effective, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on both COCO object detection and ADE20K semantic segmentation.

### 3. Method

#### 3.1. Overall Architecture

An overview of the Swin Transformer architecture is presented in Figure 3, which illustrates the tiny version (SwinT). It ﬁrst splits an input RGB image into non-overlapping patches by a patch splitting module, like ViT. Each patch is treated as a “token” and its feature is set as a concatenation of the raw pixel RGB values. In our implementation, we use a patch size of 4 × 4 and thus the feature dimension of each patch is 4 × 4 × 3 = 48. A linear embedding layer is applied on this raw-valued feature to project it to an arbitrary dimension (denoted as C).

Several Transformer blocks with modiﬁed self-attention computation (Swin Transformer blocks) are applied on these patch tokens. The Transformer blocks maintain the number of tokens (H4 × W4 ), and together with the linear embedding are referred to as “Stage 1”.

To produce a hierarchical representation, the number of tokens is reduced by patch merging layers as the network gets deeper. The ﬁrst patch merging layer concatenates the features of each group of 2 × 2 neighboring patches, and applies a linear layer on the 4C-dimensional concatenated features. This reduces the number of tokens by a multiple of 2×2 = 4 (2× downsampling of resolution), and the output dimension is set to 2C. Swin Transformer blocks are applied afterwards for feature transformation, with the resolution kept at H8 × W8 . This ﬁrst block of patch merging and feature transformation is denoted as “Stage 2”. The procedure is repeated twice, as “Stage 3” and “Stage 4”, with output resolutions of 16H × W16 and 32H × W32, respectively. These stages jointly produce a hierarchical representation,

with the same feature map resolutions as those of typical convolutional networks, e.g., VGG [52] and ResNet [30]. As a result, the proposed architecture can conveniently replace the backbone networks in existing methods for vari-

- ous vision tasks.

Swin Transformer block Swin Transformer is built by replacing the standard multi-head self attention (MSA) module in a Transformer block by a module based on shifted windows (described in Section 3.2), with other layers kept the same. As illustrated in Figure 3(b), a Swin Transformer block consists of a shifted window based MSA module, followed by a 2-layer MLP with GELU nonlinearity in between. A LayerNorm (LN) layer is applied before each MSA module and each MLP, and a residual connection is applied after each module.

#### 3.2. Shifted Window based Self-Attention

The standard Transformer architecture [64] and its adaptation for image classiﬁcation [20] both conduct global selfattention, where the relationships between a token and all other tokens are computed. The global computation leads to quadratic complexity with respect to the number of tokens, making it unsuitable for many vision problems requiring an immense set of tokens for dense prediction or to represent a high-resolution image.

Self-attention in non-overlapped windows For efﬁcient modeling, we propose to compute self-attention within local windows. The windows are arranged to evenly partition the image in a non-overlapping manner. Supposing each window contains M × M patches, the computational complexity of a global MSA module and a window based one

on an image of h × w patches are3:

Ω(MSA) = 4hwC2 + 2(hw)2C, (1) Ω(W-MSA) = 4hwC2 + 2M2hwC, (2)

where the former is quadratic to patch number hw, and the latter is linear when M is ﬁxed (set to 7 by default). Global self-attention computation is generally unaffordable for a large hw, while the window based self-attention is scalable.

Shifted window partitioning in successive blocks The window-based self-attention module lacks connections across windows, which limits its modeling power. To introduce cross-window connections while maintaining the efﬁcient computation of non-overlapping windows, we propose a shifted window partitioning approach which alternates between two partitioning conﬁgurations in consecutive Swin Transformer blocks.

As illustrated in Figure 2, the ﬁrst module uses a regular window partitioning strategy which starts from the top-left pixel, and the 8 × 8 feature map is evenly partitioned into 2 × 2 windows of size 4 × 4 (M = 4). Then, the next module adopts a windowing conﬁguration that is shifted from that of the preceding layer, by displacing the windows by ( M2 , M2 ) pixels from the regularly partitioned windows.

With the shifted window partitioning approach, consecutive Swin Transformer blocks are computed as

zˆl = W-MSA LN zl−1 + zl−1, zl = MLP LN z ˆl + zˆl, zˆl+1 = SW-MSA LN zl + zl, zl+1 = MLP LN z ˆl+1 + zˆl+1, (3)

where zˆl and zl denote the output features of the (S)WMSA module and the MLP module for block l, respectively;

- Figure 4. Illustration of an efﬁcient batch computation approach for self-attention in shifted window partitioning.

W-MSA and SW-MSA denote window based multi-head self-attention using regular and shifted window partitioning conﬁgurations, respectively.

The shifted window partitioning approach introduces connections between neighboring non-overlapping windows in the previous layer and is found to be effective in image classiﬁcation, object detection, and semantic segmentation, as shown in Table 4.

Efﬁcient batch computation for shifted conﬁguration An issue with shifted window partitioning is that it will result in more windows, from M h × M w to ( M h + 1) × ( M w +1) in the shifted conﬁguration, and some of the windows will be smaller than M × M4. A naive solution is to pad the smaller windows to a size of M × M and mask

- out the padded values when computing attention. When the number of windows in regular partitioning is small, e.g. 2 × 2, the increased computation with this naive solution is considerable (2 × 2 → 3 × 3, which is 2.25 times greater). Here, we propose a more efﬁcient batch computation approach by cyclic-shifting toward the top-left direction, as illustrated in Figure 4. After this shift, a batched window may be composed of several sub-windows that are not adjacent in the feature map, so a masking mechanism is employed to limit self-attention computation to within each sub-window. With the cyclic-shift, the number of batched windows remains the same as that of regular window partitioning, and thus is also efﬁcient. The low latency of this approach is shown in Table 5.

Relative position bias In computing self-attention, we follow [49, 1, 32, 33] by including a relative position bias

2×M2 to each head in computing similarity: Attention(Q,K,V ) = SoftMax(QKT/

- B ∈ RM

√

d + B)V, (4) where Q,K,V ∈ RM

2×d are the query, key and value matrices; d is the query/key dimension, and M2 is the number of patches in a window. Since the relative position along each axis lies in the range [−M +1,M −1], we parameterize a smaller-sized bias matrix Bˆ ∈ R(2M−1)×(2M−1), and values in B are taken from Bˆ.

4To make the window size (M, M) divisible by the feature map size of (h, w), bottom-right padding is employed on the feature map if needed.

We observe signiﬁcant improvements over counterparts without this bias term or that use absolute position embedding, as shown in Table 4. Further adding absolute position embedding to the input as in [20] drops performance slightly, thus it is not adopted in our implementation.

The learnt relative position bias in pre-training can be also used to initialize a model for ﬁne-tuning with a different window size through bi-cubic interpolation [20, 63].

#### 3.3. Architecture Variants

We build our base model, called Swin-B, to have of model size and computation complexity similar to ViTB/DeiT-B. We also introduce Swin-T, Swin-S and Swin-L, which are versions of about 0.25×, 0.5× and 2× the model size and computational complexity, respectively. Note that the complexity of Swin-T and Swin-S are similar to those of ResNet-50 (DeiT-S) and ResNet-101, respectively. The window size is set to M = 7 by default. The query dimension of each head is d = 32, and the expansion layer of each MLP is α = 4, for all experiments. The architecture hyper-parameters of these model variants are:

- • Swin-T: C = 96, layer numbers = {2,2,6,2}
- • Swin-S: C = 96, layer numbers ={2,2,18,2}
- • Swin-B: C = 128, layer numbers ={2,2,18,2}
- • Swin-L: C = 192, layer numbers ={2,2,18,2}

where C is the channel number of the hidden layers in the ﬁrst stage. The model size, theoretical computational complexity (FLOPs), and throughput of the model variants for ImageNet image classiﬁcation are listed in Table 1.

### 4. Experiments

We conduct experiments on ImageNet-1K image classiﬁcation [19], COCO object detection [43], and ADE20K semantic segmentation [83]. In the following, we ﬁrst compare the proposed Swin Transformer architecture with the previous state-of-the-arts on the three tasks. Then, we ablate the important design elements of Swin Transformer.

#### 4.1. Image Classiﬁcation on ImageNet-1K

Settings For image classiﬁcation, we benchmark the proposed Swin Transformer on ImageNet-1K [19], which contains 1.28M training images and 50K validation images from 1,000 classes. The top-1 accuracy on a single crop is reported. We consider two training settings:

• Regular ImageNet-1K training. This setting mostly follows [63]. We employ an AdamW [37] optimizer for 300 epochs using a cosine decay learning rate scheduler and 20 epochs of linear warm-up. A batch size of 1024, an initial learning rate of 0.001, and a

weight decay of 0.05 are used. We include most of the augmentation and regularization strategies of [63] in training, except for repeated augmentation [31] and EMA [45], which do not enhance performance. Note that this is contrary to [63] where repeated augmentation is crucial to stabilize the training of ViT.

• Pre-training on ImageNet-22K and ﬁne-tuning on ImageNet-1K. We also pre-train on the larger ImageNet-22K dataset, which contains 14.2 million images and 22K classes. We employ an AdamW optimizer for 90 epochs using a linear decay learning rate scheduler with a 5-epoch linear warm-up. A batch size of 4096, an initial learning rate of 0.001, and a weight decay of 0.01 are used. In ImageNet-1K ﬁne-tuning, we train the models for 30 epochs with a batch size of 1024, a constant learning rate of 10−5, and a weight decay of 10−8.

Results with regular ImageNet-1K training Table 1(a) presents comparisons to other backbones, including both Transformer-based and ConvNet-based, using regular ImageNet-1K training.

Compared to the previous state-of-the-art Transformerbased architecture, i.e. DeiT [63], Swin Transformers noticeably surpass the counterpart DeiT architectures with similar complexities: +1.5% for Swin-T (81.3%) over DeiT-S (79.8%) using 2242 input, and +1.5%/1.4% for Swin-B (83.3%/84.5%) over DeiT-B (81.8%/83.1%) using 2242/3842 input, respectively.

Compared with the state-of-the-art ConvNets, i.e. RegNet [48] and EfﬁcientNet [58], the Swin Transformer achieves a slightly better speed-accuracy trade-off. Noting that while RegNet [48] and EfﬁcientNet [58] are obtained via a thorough architecture search, the proposed Swin Transformer is adapted from the standard Transformer and has strong potential for further improvement.

Results with ImageNet-22K pre-training We also pretrain the larger-capacity Swin-B and Swin-L on ImageNet22K. Results ﬁne-tuned on ImageNet-1K image classiﬁcation are shown in Table 1(b). For Swin-B, the ImageNet22K pre-training brings 1.8%∼1.9% gains over training on ImageNet-1K from scratch. Compared with the previous best results for ImageNet-22K pre-training, our models achieve signiﬁcantly better speed-accuracy trade-offs: Swin-B obtains 86.4% top-1 accuracy, which is 2.4% higher than that of ViT with similar inference throughput (84.7 vs. 85.9 images/sec) and slightly lower FLOPs (47.0G vs. 55.4G). The larger Swin-L model achieves 87.3% top-1 accuracy, +0.9% better than that of the Swin-B model.

#### 4.2. Object Detection on COCO

Settings Object detection and instance segmentation experiments are conducted on COCO 2017, which contains 118K training, 5K validation and 20K test-dev images. An ablation study is performed using the validation set, and a system-level comparison is reported on test-dev. For the ablation study, we consider four typical object detection frameworks: Cascade Mask R-CNN [29, 6], ATSS [79], RepPoints v2 [12], and Sparse RCNN [56] in mmdetection [10]. For these four frameworks, we utilize the same settings: multi-scale training [8, 56] (resizing the input such that the shorter side is between 480 and 800 while the longer side is at most 1333), AdamW [44] optimizer (initial learning rate of 0.0001, weight decay of 0.05, and batch size of 16), and 3x schedule (36 epochs). For system-level comparison, we adopt an improved HTC [9] (denoted as HTC++) with instaboost [22], stronger multi-scale training [7], 6x schedule (72 epochs), soft-NMS [5], and ImageNet-22K pre-trained model as initialization.

vNets, i.e. ResNe(X)t, and previous Transformer networks, e.g. DeiT. The comparisons are conducted by changing only the backbones with other settings unchanged. Note that while Swin Transformer and ResNe(X)t are directly applicable to all the above frameworks because of their hierarchical feature maps, DeiT only produces a single resolution of feature maps and cannot be directly applied. For fair comparison, we follow [81] to construct hierarchical feature maps for DeiT using deconvolution layers.

Comparison to ResNe(X)t Table 2(a) lists the results of Swin-T and ResNet-50 on the four object detection frameworks. Our Swin-T architecture brings consistent +3.4∼4.2 box AP gains over ResNet-50, with slightly larger model size, FLOPs and latency.

under different model capacity using Cascade Mask RCNN. Swin Transformer achieves a high detection accuracy of 51.9 box AP and 45.0 mask AP, which are signiﬁcant gains of +3.6 box AP and +3.3 mask AP over ResNeXt10164x4d, which has similar model size, FLOPs and latency. On a higher baseline of 52.3 box AP and 46.0 mask AP using an improved HTC framework, the gains by Swin Transformer are also high, at +4.1 box AP and +3.1 mask AP (see Table 2(c)). Regarding inference speed, while ResNe(X)t is built by highly optimized Cudnn functions, our architecture is implemented with built-in PyTorch functions that are not all well-optimized. A thorough kernel optimization is beyond the scope of this paper.

Comparison to DeiT The performance of DeiT-S using the Cascade Mask R-CNN framework is shown in Table 2(b). The results of Swin-T are +2.5 box AP and +2.3 mask AP higher than DeiT-S with similar model size (86M vs. 80M) and signiﬁcantly higher inference speed (15.3 FPS vs. 10.4 FPS). The lower inference speed of DeiT is mainly due to its quadratic complexity to input image size.

Comparison to previous state-of-the-art Table 2(c) compares our best results with those of previous state-ofthe-art models. Our best model achieves 58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev, surpassing the previous best results by +2.7 box AP (Copy-paste [26] without external data) and +2.6 mask AP (DetectoRS [46]).

categories. It has 25K images in total, with 20K for training, 2K for validation, and another 3K for testing. We utilize UperNet [69] in mmseg [16] as our base framework for its high efﬁciency. More details are presented in the Appendix.

Results Table 3 lists the mIoU, model size (#param), FLOPs and FPS for different method/backbone pairs. From these results, it can be seen that Swin-S is +5.3 mIoU higher

- (49.3 vs. 44.0) than DeiT-S with similar computation cost. It is also +4.4 mIoU higher than ResNet-101, and +2.4 mIoU higher than ResNeSt-101 [78]. Our Swin-L model with ImageNet-22K pre-training achieves 53.5 mIoU on the val set, surpassing the previous best model by +3.2 mIoU
- (50.3 mIoU by SETR [81] which has a larger model size).

#### 4.4. Ablation Study

In this section, we ablate important design elements in the proposed Swin Transformer, using ImageNet-1K image classiﬁcation, Cascade Mask R-CNN on COCO object detection, and UperNet on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

Shifted windows Ablations of the shifted window approach on the three tasks are reported in Table 4. Swin-T with the shifted window partitioning outperforms the counterpart built on a single window partitioning at each stage by +1.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, +2.8 box AP/+2.2 mask AP on COCO, and +2.8 mIoU on ADE20K. The results indicate the effectiveness of using shifted windows to build connections among windows in the preceding layers. The latency overhead by shifted window is also small, as shown in Table 5.

Relative position bias Table 4 shows comparisons of different position embedding approaches. Swin-T with relative position bias yields +1.2%/+0.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, +1.3/+1.5 box AP and +1.1/+1.3 mask AP

on COCO, and +2.3/+2.9 mIoU on ADE20K in relation to those without position encoding and with absolute position embedding, respectively, indicating the effectiveness of the relative position bias. Also note that while the inclusion of absolute position embedding improves image classiﬁcation accuracy (+0.4%), it harms object detection and semantic segmentation (-0.2 box/mask AP on COCO and -0.6 mIoU on ADE20K).

While the recent ViT/DeiT models abandon translation invariance in image classiﬁcation even though it has long been shown to be crucial for visual modeling, we ﬁnd that inductive bias that encourages certain translation invariance is still preferable for general-purpose visual modeling, particularly for the dense prediction tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation.

Different self-attention methods The real speed of different self-attention computation methods and implementations are compared in Table 5. Our cyclic implementation is more hardware efﬁcient than naive padding, particularly for deeper stages. Overall, it brings a 13%, 18% and 18% speed-up on Swin-T, Swin-S and Swin-B, respectively.

The self-attention modules built on the proposed shifted window approach are 40.8×/2.5×, 20.2×/2.5×, 9.3×/2.1×, and 7.6×/1.8× more efﬁcient than those of sliding windows in naive/kernel implementations on four network stages, respectively. Overall, the Swin Transformer architectures built on shifted windows are 4.1/1.5, 4.0/1.5, 3.6/1.5 times faster than variants built on sliding windows for Swin-T, Swin-S, and Swin-B, respectively. Table 6 compares their accuracy on the three tasks, showing that they are similarly accurate in visual modeling.

Compared to Performer [14], which is one of the fastest Transformer architectures (see [60]), the proposed shifted window based self-attention computation and the overall Swin Transformer architectures are slightly faster (see Table 5), while achieving +2.3% top-1 accuracy compared to Performer on ImageNet-1K using Swin-T (see Table 6).

sentation and has linear computational complexity with respect to input image size. Swin Transformer achieves the state-of-the-art performance on COCO object detection and ADE20K semantic segmentation, signiﬁcantly surpassing previous best methods. We hope that Swin Transformer’s strong performance on various vision problems will encourage uniﬁed modeling of vision and language signals.

As a key element of Swin Transformer, the shifted window based self-attention is shown to be effective and efﬁcient on vision problems, and we look forward to investigating its use in natural language processing as well.

### A1. Detailed Architectures

The detailed architecture speciﬁcations are shown in Table 7, where an input image size of 224×224 is assumed for all architectures. “Concat n × n” indicates a concatenation of n × n neighboring features in a patch. This operation results in a downsampling of the feature map by a rate of n. “96-d” denotes a linear layer with an output dimension of 96. “win. sz. 7 × 7” indicates a multi-head self-attention module with window size of 7 × 7.

### A2. Detailed Experimental Settings

#### A2.1. Image classiﬁcation on ImageNet-1K

The image classiﬁcation is performed by applying a global average pooling layer on the output feature map of the last stage, followed by a linear classiﬁer. We ﬁnd this strategy to be as accurate as using an additional class token as in ViT [20] and DeiT [63]. In evaluation, the top-1 accuracy using a single crop is reported.

Regular ImageNet-1K training The training settings mostly follow [63]. For all model variants, we adopt a default input image resolution of 2242. For other resolutions such as 3842, we ﬁne-tune the models trained at 2242 resolution, instead of training from scratch, to reduce GPU consumption.

When training from scratch with a 2242 input, we employ an AdamW [37] optimizer for 300 epochs using a cosine decay learning rate scheduler with 20 epochs of linear warm-up. A batch size of 1024, an initial learning rate of 0.001, a weight decay of 0.05, and gradient clipping with a max norm of 1 are used. We include most of the augmentation and regularization strategies of [63] in training, including RandAugment [17], Mixup [77], Cutmix [75], random erasing [82] and stochastic depth [35], but not repeated augmentation [31] and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) [45] which do not enhance performance. Note that this is contrary to [63] where repeated augmentation is crucial to stabilize the training of ViT. An increasing degree of stochastic depth augmentation is employed for larger models, i.e. 0.2,0.3,0.5 for Swin-T, Swin-S, and Swin-B, respectively.

For ﬁne-tuning on input with larger resolution, we employ an adamW [37] optimizer for 30 epochs with a constant learning rate of 10−5, weight decay of 10−8, and the same data augmentation and regularizations as the ﬁrst stage except for setting the stochastic depth ratio to 0.1.

ImageNet-22K pre-training We also pre-train on the larger ImageNet-22K dataset, which contains 14.2 million images and 22K classes. The training is done in two stages. For the ﬁrst stage with 2242 input, we employ an AdamW optimizer for 90 epochs using a linear decay learning rate scheduler with a 5-epoch linear warm-up. A batch size of 4096, an initial learning rate of 0.001, and a weight decay of 0.01 are used. In the second stage of ImageNet-1K ﬁnetuning with 2242/3842 input, we train the models for 30 epochs with a batch size of 1024, a constant learning rate of 10−5, and a weight decay of 10−8.

#### A2.2. Object detection on COCO

For an ablation study, we consider four typical object detection frameworks: Cascade Mask R-CNN [29, 6], ATSS [79], RepPoints v2 [12], and Sparse RCNN [56] in mmdetection [10]. For these four frameworks, we utilize the same settings: multi-scale training [8, 56] (resizing the input such that the shorter side is between 480 and 800 while the longer side is at most 1333), AdamW [44] optimizer (initial learning rate of 0.0001, weight decay of 0.05, and batch size of 16), and 3x schedule (36 epochs with the learning rate decayed by 10× at epochs 27 and 33).

For system-level comparison, we adopt an improved HTC [9] (denoted as HTC++) with instaboost [22], stronger multi-scale training [7] (resizing the input such that the shorter side is between 400 and 1400 while the longer side is at most 1600), 6x schedule (72 epochs with the learning rate decayed at epochs 63 and 69 by a factor of 0.1), softNMS [5], and an extra global self-attention layer appended at the output of last stage and ImageNet-22K pre-trained

#### A2.3. Semantic segmentation on ADE20K

ADE20K [83] is a widely-used semantic segmentation dataset, covering a broad range of 150 semantic categories. It has 25K images in total, with 20K for training, 2K for validation, and another 3K for testing. We utilize UperNet [69] in mmsegmentation [16] as our base framework for its high efﬁciency.

In training, we employ the AdamW [44] optimizer with an initial learning rate of 6 × 10−5, a weight decay of 0.01, a scheduler that uses linear learning rate decay, and a linear warmup of 1,500 iterations. Models are trained on 8 GPUs with 2 images per GPU for 160K iterations. For augmentations, we adopt the default setting in mmsegmentation of random horizontal ﬂipping, random re-scaling within ratio range [0.5, 2.0] and random photometric distortion. Stochastic depth with ratio of 0.2 is applied for all Swin Transformer models. Swin-T, Swin-S are trained on the standard setting as the previous approaches with an input of 512×512. Swin-B and Swin-L with ‡ indicate that these two models are pre-trained on ImageNet-22K, and trained with the input of 640×640.

In inference, a multi-scale test using resolutions that are [0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75]× of that in training is employed. When reporting test scores, both the training images and validation images are used for training, following common practice [71].

#### A3.2.DifferentOptimizersforResNe(X)tonCOCO

Table 9 compares the AdamW and SGD optimizers of the ResNe(X)t backbones on COCO object detection. The Cascade Mask R-CNN framework is used in this comparison. While SGD is used as a default optimizer for Cascade Mask R-CNN framework, we generally observe improved accuracy by replacing it with an AdamW optimizer, particularly for smaller backbones. We thus use AdamW for ResNe(X)t backbones when compared to the proposed Swin Transformer architectures.

Table 10. Performance of Swin MLP-Mixer on ImageNet-1K classiﬁcation. D indictes the number of channels per head. Throughput is measured using the GitHub repository of [68] and a V100 GPU, following [63].

proach, ResMLP [61]. Swin-Mixer performs signiﬁcantly better than MLP-Mixer (81.3% vs. 76.4%) using slightly smaller computation budget (10.4G vs. 12.7G). It also has better speed accuracy trade-off compared to ResMLP [62]. These results indicate the proposed hierarchical design and the shifted window approach are generalizable.
