### Abstract

Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a ﬁxed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefﬁcient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet.

To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfﬁcientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efﬁciency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfﬁcientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfﬁcientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

### 1. Introduction

Scaling up ConvNets is widely used to achieve better accuracy. For example, ResNet (He et al., 2016) can be scaled up from ResNet-18 to ResNet-200 by using more layers; Recently, GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) achieved 84.3% ImageNet top-1 accuracy by scaling up a baseline model four

Figure 1. Model Size vs. ImageNet Accuracy. All numbers are for single-crop, single-model. Our EfﬁcientNets signiﬁcantly outperform other ConvNets. In particular, EfﬁcientNet-B7 achieves new state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy but being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster than GPipe. EfﬁcientNet-B1 is 7.6x smaller and 5.7x faster than ResNet-152. Details are in Table 2 and 4.

time larger. However, the process of scaling up ConvNets has never been well understood and there are currently many ways to do it. The most common way is to scale up ConvNets by their depth (He et al., 2016) or width (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). Another less common, but increasingly popular, method is to scale up models by image resolution (Huang et al., 2018). In previous work, it is common to scale only one of the three dimensions – depth, width, and image size. Though it is possible to scale two or three dimensions arbitrarily, arbitrary scaling requires tedious manual tuning and still often yields sub-optimal accuracy and efﬁciency.

In this paper, we want to study and rethink the process of scaling up ConvNets. In particular, we investigate the central question: is there a principled method to scale up ConvNets that can achieve better accuracy and efﬁciency? Our empirical study shows that it is critical to balance all dimensions of network width/depth/resolution, and surprisingly such balance can be achieved by simply scaling each of them with constant ratio. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective compound scaling method. Unlike conventional practice that arbitrary scales these factors, our method uniformly scales network width, depth,

For example, if we want to use 2N times more computational resources, then we can simply increase the network depth by αN, width by βN, and image size by γN, where α,β,γ are constant coefﬁcients determined by a small grid search on the original small model.

### 2. Related Work

ConvNet Accuracy: Since AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) won the 2012 ImageNet competition, ConvNets have become increasingly more accurate by going bigger: while the 2014 ImageNet winner GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) achieves 74.8% top-1 accuracy with about 6.8M parameters, the 2017 ImageNet winner SENet (Hu et al., 2018) achieves 82.7% top-1 accuracy with 145M parameters. Recently, GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) further pushes the state-of-the-art ImageNet top-1 validation accuracy to 84.3% using 557M parameters: it is so big that it can only be trained with a specialized pipeline parallelism library by partitioning the network and spreading each part to a different accelerator. While these models are mainly designed for ImageNet, recent studies have shown better ImageNet models also perform better across a variety of transfer learning datasets (Kornblith et al., 2019), and other computer vision tasks such as object detection (He et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019). Although higher accuracy is critical for many applications, we have already hit the hardware memory limit, and thus further accuracy gain needs better efﬁciency.

Intuitively, the compound scaling method makes sense because if the input image is bigger, then the network needs more layers to increase the receptive ﬁeld and more channels to capture more ﬁne-grained patterns on the bigger image. In fact, previous theoretical (Raghu et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018) and empirical results (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) both show that there exists certain relationship between network width and depth, but to our best knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to empirically quantify the relationship among all three dimensions of network width, depth, and resolution.

We demonstrate that our scaling method work well on existing MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017; Sandler et al., 2018) and ResNet (He et al., 2016). Notably, the effectiveness of model scaling heavily depends on the baseline network; to go even further, we use neural architecture search (Zoph & Le, 2017; Tan et al., 2019) to develop a new baseline network, and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfﬁcientNets. Figure 1 summarizes the ImageNet performance, where our EfﬁcientNets signiﬁcantly outperform other ConvNets. In particular, our EfﬁcientNet-B7 surpasses the best existing GPipe accuracy (Huang et al., 2018), but using 8.4x fewer parameters and running 6.1x faster on inference. Compared to the widely used ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016), our EfﬁcientNet-B4 improves the top-1 accuracy from 76.3% to 83.0% (+6.7%) with similar FLOPS. Besides ImageNet, EfﬁcientNets also transfer well and achieve state-

ConvNet Efﬁciency: Deep ConvNets are often overparameterized. Model compression (Han et al., 2016; He et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) is a common way to reduce model size by trading accuracy for efﬁciency. As mobile phones become ubiquitous, it is also common to handcraft efﬁcient mobile-size ConvNets, such as SqueezeNets (Iandola et al., 2016; Gholami et al., 2018), MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017; Sandler et al., 2018), and ShufﬂeNets

(Zhang et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018). Recently, neural architecture search becomes increasingly popular in designing efﬁcient mobile-size ConvNets (Tan et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019), and achieves even better efﬁciency than hand-crafted mobile ConvNets by extensively tuning the network width, depth, convolution kernel types and sizes. However, it is unclear how to apply these techniques for larger models that have much larger design space and much more expensive tuning cost. In this paper, we aim to study model efﬁciency for super large ConvNets that surpass state-of-the-art accuracy. To achieve this goal, we resort to model scaling.

Model Scaling: There are many ways to scale a ConvNet for different resource constraints: ResNet (He et al., 2016) can be scaled down (e.g., ResNet-18) or up (e.g., ResNet-200) by adjusting network depth (#layers), while WideResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) and MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017) can be scaled by network width (#channels). It is also well-recognized that bigger input image size will help accuracy with the overhead of more FLOPS. Although prior studies (Raghu et al., 2017; Lin & Jegelka, 2018; Sharir & Shashua, 2018; Lu et al.,

- 2018) have shown that network depth and width are both important for ConvNets’ expressive power, it still remains an open question of how to effectively scale a ConvNet to achieve better efﬁciency and accuracy. Our work systematically and empirically studies ConvNet scaling for all three dimensions of network width, depth, and resolutions.

i. Figure 2(a) illustrate a representative ConvNet, where the spatial dimension is gradually shrunk but the channel dimension is expanded over layers, for example, from initial input shape 224,224,3 to ﬁnal output shape 7,7,512 .

Unlike regular ConvNet designs that mostly focus on ﬁnding the best layer architecture Fi, model scaling tries to expand the network length (Li), width (Ci), and/or resolution (Hi,Wi) without changing Fi predeﬁned in the baseline network. By ﬁxing Fi, model scaling simpliﬁes the design problem for new resource constraints, but it still remains a large design space to explore different Li,Ci,Hi,Wi for each layer. In order to further reduce the design space, we restrict that all layers must be scaled uniformly with constant ratio. Our target is to maximize the model accuracy for any given resource constraints, which can be formulated as an optimization problem:

Accuracy N(d,w,r) s.t. N(d,w,r) =

(2) where w,d,r are coefﬁcients for scaling network width, depth, and resolution; Fˆi,Lˆi,Hˆi,Wˆi,Cˆi are predeﬁned parameters in baseline network (see Table 1 as an example).

### 3. Compound Model Scaling

In this section, we will formulate the scaling problem, study different approaches, and propose our new scaling method.

#### 3.1. Problem Formulation

A ConvNet Layer i can be deﬁned as a function: Yi = Fi(Xi), where Fi is the operator, Yi is output tensor, Xi is input tensor, with tensor shape Hi,Wi,Ci 1, where Hi and Wi are spatial dimension and Ci is the channel dimension. A ConvNet N can be represented by a list of composed layers: N = Fk ... F2  F1(X1) = j=1...k Fj(X1). In practice, ConvNet layers are often partitioned into multiple stages and all layers in each stage share the same architecture: for example, ResNet (He et al., 2016) has ﬁve stages, and all layers in each stage has the same convolutional type except the ﬁrst layer performs down-sampling. Therefore, we can deﬁne a ConvNet as:

##### FL

i,Wi,Ci (1)

##### N =

i X H

i

i=1...s

where FL

i denotes layer Fi is repeated Li times in stage i, Hi,Wi,Ci denotes the shape of input tensor X of layer

i

1For the sake of simplicity, we omit batch dimension.

#### 3.2. Scaling Dimensions

The main difﬁculty of problem 2 is that the optimal d,w,r depend on each other and the values change under different resource constraints. Due to this difﬁculty, conventional methods mostly scale ConvNets in one of these dimensions:

Depth (d): Scaling network depth is the most common way used by many ConvNets (He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Szegedy et al., 2015; 2016). The intuition is that deeper ConvNet can capture richer and more complex features, and generalize well on new tasks. However, deeper networks are also more difﬁcult to train due to the vanishing gradient problem (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). Although several techniques, such as skip connections (He et al., 2016) and batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), alleviate the training problem, the accuracy gain of very deep network diminishes: for example, ResNet-1000 has similar accuracy as ResNet-101 even though it has much more layers. Figure 3 (middle) shows our empirical study on scaling a baseline model with different depth coefﬁcient d, further suggesting the diminishing accuracy return for very deep ConvNets.

Width (w): Scaling network width is commonly used for small size models (Howard et al., 2017; Sandler et al., 2018;

- Figure 3. Scaling Up a Baseline Model with Different Network Width (w), Depth (d), and Resolution (r) Coefﬁcients. Bigger networks with larger width, depth, or resolution tend to achieve higher accuracy, but the accuracy gain quickly saturate after reaching 80%, demonstrating the limitation of single dimension scaling. Baseline network is described in Table 1.

Tan et al., 2019)2. As discussed in (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), wider networks tend to be able to capture more ﬁne-grained features and are easier to train. However, extremely wide but shallow networks tend to have difﬁculties in capturing higher level features. Our empirical results in Figure 3 (left) show that the accuracy quickly saturates when networks become much wider with larger w.

Resolution (r): With higher resolution input images, ConvNets can potentially capture more ﬁne-grained patterns. Starting from 224x224 in early ConvNets, modern ConvNets tend to use 299x299 (Szegedy et al., 2016) or 331x331 (Zoph et al., 2018) for better accuracy. Recently, GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) achieves state-of-the-art ImageNet accuracy with 480x480 resolution. Higher resolutions, such as 600x600, are also widely used in object detection ConvNets (He et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017). Figure 3 (right) shows the results of scaling network resolutions, where indeed higher resolutions improve accuracy, but the accuracy gain diminishes for very high resolutions (r = 1.0 denotes resolution 224x224 and r = 2.5 denotes resolution 560x560). The above analyses lead us to the ﬁrst observation:

Observation 1 – Scaling up any dimension of network width, depth, or resolution improves accuracy, but the accuracy gain diminishes for bigger models.

#### 3.3. Compound Scaling

We empirically observe that different scaling dimensions are not independent. Intuitively, for higher resolution images, we should increase network depth, such that the larger receptive ﬁelds can help capture similar features that include more pixels in bigger images. Correspondingly, we should also increase network width when resolution is higher, in

2In some literature, scaling number of channels is called “depth multiplier”, which means the same as our width coefﬁcient w.

Figure 4. Scaling Network Width for Different Baseline Networks. Each dot in a line denotes a model with different width coefﬁcient (w). All baseline networks are from Table 1. The ﬁrst baseline network (d=1.0, r=1.0) has 18 convolutional layers with resolution 224x224, while the last baseline (d=2.0, r=1.3) has 36 layers with resolution 299x299.

order to capture more ﬁne-grained patterns with more pixels in high resolution images. These intuitions suggest that we need to coordinate and balance different scaling dimensions rather than conventional single-dimension scaling.

To validate our intuitions, we compare width scaling under different network depths and resolutions, as shown in Figure 4. If we only scale network width w without changing depth (d=1.0) and resolution (r=1.0), the accuracy saturates quickly. With deeper (d=2.0) and higher resolution (r=2.0), width scaling achieves much better accuracy under the same FLOPS cost. These results lead us to the second observation:

Observation 2 – In order to pursue better accuracy and efﬁciency, it is critical to balance all dimensions of network width, depth, and resolution during ConvNet scaling.

In fact, a few prior work (Zoph et al., 2018; Real et al., 2019) have already tried to arbitrarily balance network width and depth, but they all require tedious manual tuning.

In this paper, we propose a new compound scaling method, which use a compound coefﬁcient φ to uniformly scales network width, depth, and resolution in a principled way:

depth: d = αφ width: w = βφ

resolution: r = γφ s.t. α · β2 · γ2 ≈ 2

α ≥ 1,β ≥ 1,γ ≥ 1

(3)

where α,β,γ are constants that can be determined by a small grid search. Intuitively, φ is a user-speciﬁed coefﬁcient that controls how many more resources are available for model scaling, while α,β,γ specify how to assign these extra resources to network width, depth, and resolution respectively. Notably, the FLOPS of a regular convolution op is proportional to d, w2, r2, i.e., doubling network depth will double FLOPS, but doubling network width or resolution will increase FLOPS by four times. Since convolution ops usually dominate the computation cost in ConvNets, scaling a ConvNet with equation 3 will approximately increase total FLOPS by α · β2 · γ2 φ. In this paper, we constraint α · β2 · γ2 ≈ 2 such that for any new φ, the total FLOPS will approximately3 increase by 2φ.

### 4. EfﬁcientNet Architecture

Since model scaling does not change layer operators Fˆi in baseline network, having a good baseline network is also critical. We will evaluate our scaling method using existing ConvNets, but in order to better demonstrate the effectiveness of our scaling method, we have also developed a new mobile-size baseline, called EfﬁcientNet.

Inspired by (Tan et al., 2019), we develop our baseline network by leveraging a multi-objective neural architecture search that optimizes both accuracy and FLOPS. Speciﬁcally, we use the same search space as (Tan et al., 2019), and use ACC(m)×[FLOPS(m)/T]w as the optimization goal, where ACC(m) and FLOPS(m) denote the accuracy and FLOPS of model m, T is the target FLOPS and w=-0.07 is a hyperparameter for controlling the trade-off between accuracy and FLOPS. Unlike (Tan et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019), here we optimize FLOPS rather than latency since we are not targeting any speciﬁc hardware device. Our search produces an efﬁcient network, which we name EfﬁcientNet-B0. Since we use the same search space as (Tan et al., 2019), the architecture is similar to Mnas-

3FLOPS may differ from theoretical value due to rounding.

Net, except our EfﬁcientNet-B0 is slightly bigger due to the larger FLOPS target (our FLOPS target is 400M). Table 1 shows the architecture of EfﬁcientNet-B0. Its main building block is mobile inverted bottleneck MBConv (Sandler et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019), to which we also add squeeze-and-excitation optimization (Hu et al., 2018).

Starting from the baseline EfﬁcientNet-B0, we apply our compound scaling method to scale it up with two steps:

- • STEP 1: we ﬁrst ﬁx φ = 1, assuming twice more resources available, and do a small grid search of α,β,γ based on Equation 2 and 3. In particular, we ﬁnd the best values for EfﬁcientNet-B0 are α = 1.2,β = 1.1,γ = 1.15, under constraint of α · β2 · γ2 ≈ 2.
- • STEP 2: we then ﬁx α,β,γ as constants and scale up baseline network with different φ using Equation 3, to obtain EfﬁcientNet-B1 to B7 (Details in Table 2).

Notably, it is possible to achieve even better performance by searching for α,β,γ directly around a large model, but the search cost becomes prohibitively more expensive on larger models. Our method solves this issue by only doing search once on the small baseline network (step 1), and then use the same scaling coefﬁcients for all other models (step 2).

### 5. Experiments

In this section, we will ﬁrst evaluate our scaling method on existing ConvNets and the new proposed EfﬁcientNets.

#### 5.1. Scaling Up MobileNets and ResNets

As a proof of concept, we ﬁrst apply our scaling method to the widely-used MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017; Sandler et al., 2018) and ResNet (He et al., 2016). Table 3 shows the ImageNet results of scaling them in different ways. Compared to other single-dimension scaling methods, our compound scaling method improves the accuracy on all these models, suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed scaling method for general existing ConvNets.

Table 2. EfﬁcientNet Performance Results on ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015). All EfﬁcientNet models are scaled from our baseline EfﬁcientNet-B0 using different compound coefﬁcient φ in Equation 3. ConvNets with similar top-1/top-5 accuracy are grouped together for efﬁciency comparison. Our scaled EfﬁcientNet models consistently reduce parameters and FLOPS by an order of magnitude (up to 8.4x parameter reduction and up to 16x FLOPS reduction) than existing ConvNets.

weight decay 1e-5; initial learning rate 0.256 that decays by 0.97 every 2.4 epochs. We also use SiLU (Swish-1) activation (Ramachandran et al., 2018; Elfwing et al., 2018; Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016), AutoAugment (Cubuk et al.,

- 2019), and stochastic depth (Huang et al., 2016) with survival probability 0.8. As commonly known that bigger models need more regularization, we linearly increase dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) ratio from 0.2 for EfﬁcientNet-B0 to 0.5 for B7. We reserve 25K randomly picked images from the training set as a minival set, and perform early stopping on this minival; we then evaluate the earlystopped checkpoint on the original validation set to report the ﬁnal validation accuracy.

Table 2 shows the performance of all EfﬁcientNet models that are scaled from the same baseline EfﬁcientNet-B0. Our EfﬁcientNet models generally use an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPS than other ConvNets with similar accuracy. In particular, our EfﬁcientNet-B7 achieves 84.3% top1 accuracy with 66M parameters and 37B FLOPS,

being more accurate but 8.4x smaller than the previous best GPipe (Huang et al., 2018). These gains come from both better architectures, better scaling, and better training settings that are customized for EfﬁcientNet.

Figure 1 and Figure 5 illustrates the parameters-accuracy and FLOPS-accuracy curve for representative ConvNets, where our scaled EfﬁcientNet models achieve better accuracy with much fewer parameters and FLOPS than other ConvNets. Notably, our EfﬁcientNet models are not only small, but also computational cheaper. For example, our EfﬁcientNet-B3 achieves higher accuracy than ResNeXt101 (Xie et al., 2017) using 18x fewer FLOPS.

To validate the latency, we have also measured the inference latency for a few representative CovNets on a real CPU as shown in Table 4, where we report average latency over 20 runs. Our EfﬁcientNet-B1 runs 5.7x faster than the widely used ResNet-152, while EfﬁcientNet-B7 runs about 6.1x faster than GPipe (Huang et al., 2018), suggesting our EfﬁcientNets are indeed fast on real hardware.

#### 5.3. Transfer Learning Results for EfﬁcientNet

We have also evaluated our EfﬁcientNet on a list of commonly used transfer learning datasets, as shown in Table

###### 6. We borrow the same training settings from (Kornblith et al., 2019) and (Huang et al., 2018), which take ImageNet pretrained checkpoints and ﬁnetune on new datasets.

Table 5 shows the transfer learning performance: (1) Compared to public available models, such as NASNet-A (Zoph et al., 2018) and Inception-v4 (Szegedy et al., 2017), our EfﬁcientNet models achieve better accuracy with 4.7x average (up to 21x) parameter reduction. (2) Compared to stateof-the-art models, including DAT (Ngiam et al., 2018) that dynamically synthesizes training data and GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) that is trained with specialized pipeline parallelism, our EfﬁcientNet models still surpass their accuracy in 5 out of 8 datasets, but using 9.6x fewer parameters

Figure 6 compares the accuracy-parameters curve for a variety of models. In general, our EfﬁcientNets consistently achieve better accuracy with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than existing models, including ResNet (He et al., 2016), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017), Inception (Szegedy et al., 2017), and NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018).

ods for the same EfﬁcientNet-B0 baseline network. In general, all scaling methods improve accuracy with the cost of more FLOPS, but our compound scaling method can further improve accuracy, by up to 2.5%, than other singledimension scaling methods, suggesting the importance of our proposed compound scaling.

In order to further understand why our compound scaling method is better than others, Figure 7 compares the class activation map (Zhou et al., 2016) for a few representative models with different scaling methods. All these models are scaled from the same baseline, and their statistics are shown in Table 7. Images are randomly picked from ImageNet validation set. As shown in the ﬁgure, the model with compound scaling tends to focus on more relevant regions with more object details, while other models are either lack of object details or unable to capture all objects in the images.

### 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we systematically study ConvNet scaling and identify that carefully balancing network width, depth, and resolution is an important but missing piece, preventing us from better accuracy and efﬁciency. To address this issue, we propose a simple and highly effective compound scaling method, which enables us to easily scale up a baseline ConvNet to any target resource constraints in a more principled way, while maintaining model efﬁciency. Powered by this compound scaling method, we demonstrate that a mobilesize EfﬁcientNet model can be scaled up very effectively, surpassing state-of-the-art accuracy with an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPS, on both ImageNet and ﬁve commonly used transfer learning datasets.

### Appendix

Since 2017, most research papers only report and compare ImageNet validation accuracy; this paper also follows this convention for better comparison. In addition, we have also veriﬁed the test accuracy by submitting our predictions on the 100k test set images to http://image-net.org; results are in Table 8. As expected, the test accuracy is very close to the validation accuracy.
